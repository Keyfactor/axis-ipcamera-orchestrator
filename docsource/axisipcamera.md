## Overview

The AXIS IP Camera certificate store type represents a certificate store on an AXIS network camera
that maintains two separate collections of certificates:
* Client-server certificates (certs with private keys)
* CA certificates

It is expected that there be one (1) certificate store managed per AXIS network camera.

## Requirements

1. User Account with \'Administrator\' privileges and password to access the camera
2. Camera serial number
3. Camera IP address (and likely port number)
