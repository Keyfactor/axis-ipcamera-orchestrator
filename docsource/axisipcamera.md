## Overview

The Axis IP Camera certificate store type represents a certificate store on an Axis network camera
that maintains two separate collections of certificates:
* Client-server certificates (certs with private keys)
* CA certificates

It is expected that there be one (1) certificate store managed per Axis network camera.

## Requirements

1. User Account with \`Administrator\` privileges and password to access the camera
2. Camera serial number
3. Camera IP address (and likely port number)
